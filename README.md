# Smart Contracts

This is the second course of the Blockchain Specialization offered by University of Buffalo and The State University of New York.

This repository contains various programs I've coded while learning Solidity.

The Final Project of the Course  is [AuctionVersion2.sol](https://github.com/ShubhamPalriwala/Solidity-Basics/blob/master/AuctionVersion2.sol)

It is a Smart Contract made to conduct an Auction.

More details can be found here:
